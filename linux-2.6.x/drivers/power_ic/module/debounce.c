 * @brief This is the main file of the power IC debouncing routines
 *
 * This file handles the debouncing of various interrupts from the power IC.
 * The module is desgined to be as generic as possible, with a table that
 * defines the interrupts that are to be monitored (debounced) along with
 * a callback function to be called when a change to the signal has been
 * fully debounced.
 *
 * Currently, this file handles debouncing of the power key, barrel headset,
 * and barrel headset send/end key.  In the future, stereo headset detection
 * will need to be added as well.

/*!
 * @brief the kernel thread responsible for debouncing
 *
 * This function implements the thread responsible for the majority of the
 * debounce handling.  The thread consists of an infinite loop that will
 * wait for interrupts and/or timer expirations.
 *
 * When an event arrives, it is placed into a queue and then the thread is
 * woken up.  When the thread wakes up, it takes events off of the queue and
 * handles them.  For each event handled, the current interrupt sense bit is
 * compared with the previous state of the sense bit.  If the sense bit stays
 * in the same state for X consecutive iterations (where X is defined on a
 * per-event basis), the callback function is called for the event.
 *
 * When not debouncing, the only thing that would cause the thread to start
 * running is an interrupt from the power IC.  While it is in the process or
 * debouncing an event, the event's interrupt is masked and a timer is used
 * to periodically poll the state of the sense bit.  Once debouncing is
 * complete, the interrupt is unmasked.
 *
 * In order to try to eliminate any interrupt race conditions, the interrupt
 * flag is always cleared whenever the interrupt sense is read.  Then, when
 * the interrupt is unmasked, the status is NOT cleared.  This will cause
 * the interrupt to fire immediately if the interrupt sense were to have
 * changed between the time it was last read and the time that the
 * interrupt was unmasked.
 *
 * @param unused An unused parameter

 * @returns 0, but should never actually return
